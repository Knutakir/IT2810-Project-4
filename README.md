# Project 4

Mountain Finder is a website with over 1000 mountains with height over 2000 meters. You can search, sort and filter the mountains, and by clicking a specific mountain in the list, a modal appears with detailed mountain data. In this modal, you can rate the chosen mountain from 1-5, and see the total score. The mountain is rated by clicking the number of stars wanted. You can only rate once for every phone (or download instance). 

## Install and Run

The client is set up to use the server on the VM, to use your own server with database ...

### Server
```sh
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ npm run init-db
$ npm start
```

### Client
```sh
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## React Native and reuse code 
React Native was used for this project. To reuse code from the previous project which used React, some changes had to be done. The components from React and React Native does not only have different names, but often different functionality and/or styling too. 

View div

TouchableOpacity button

css stylesheet
structure -> only one file


## Expo
Expo is used for this project to make the development of the React Native applicaton fast and easy. Expo is a a platform for making universal applications with React Native that runs on iOS and Android. It has a lot of useful tools that is built around React Native that we used in this project, such as the `expo-cli` and `@expo/vector-icons`. The group used the expo CLI for installing, initializing and running the project:
```sh
$ npm install --global expo-cli
$ expo init <project-name>
$ cd <project-name>
$ expo start
```
The CLI worked as a provider of the mobile client by using a mobile client of expo on the phones and either scanning a QR-code (which directed to a URL) or by manually insering a URL in the web browser. This started the downloading of the application to the phone and running it afterwards.
The command line interface also provided fast upload of the application after every safe of source files in the project to the devices.

## Redux

## AsyncStorage

## Git usage and code style
The group used issues with connected branches for the bigger tasks of the project. The commits was also marked with which issue they contributed to. 

### Lint
The group used ESLint for linting. To run the linting, use this command in the `server` or `client` directory: 
```sh
$ npm run lint
```

## Testing
### Responsive design and OS
The group tested the application on three different mobile devices, an iPhone 5s with iOS, a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 with Android and a Samsung Galaxy S9+.

Picker, small other changes

Another challenge was to adapt the application to both the iPhone and the Samsung Tab. The iPhone that were used is a very small device, and the tab is significantly larger. This lead to "sm√•fiksing" to make the application look good enough on all of the devices, where a library with viewport height and width came in handy.

#### Scenario 1
1. Chose filtering option ... 
2. Chose filtering option ...
3. Expect that the list will show ... first

#### Scenario 2
1. Sort by height 
2. Click arrow
3. Expect .. to 
4. Filter by only mountains over 8...
5. expect 3 results.. 

#### Scenario 3
1. rate
2. get message
3. cant rate again
4. close app
5. check mountain, cant rate again 

#### Scenario 4
1. page 3
2. search
3. Expect to be on page 1

#### Scenario 5
1. search
2. bla ned
3. Expect to show .. pages
4. click last page
5. expect to see .. as last mountains

### Tests
To run server tests from the previous project run these commands: 
```sh
$ cd server
$ npm test
```
